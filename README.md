This package provides a simple utility function for comparing values in a test. The goal is extreme simplicity:

```golang
import (
    "testing"

    "github.com/nitroshare/compare"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

    // Second and third parameter are compared and the fourth parameter
    // determines if they should match; in this case, they should...
    compare.Compare(t, 1, 1, true)

    // ...and in this case they should not
    compare.Compare(t, 1, 2, false)
}
```
